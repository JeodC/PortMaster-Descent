# Descent 1/2 For PortMaster
The MS-DOS games by Parallax Software ported with DXX-Rebirth.

## Compatibility
ArkOS is NOT compatible with this port. Users will encounter the following error on attempting to run:
```
./d1x-rebirth: /lib/aarch64-linux-gnu/libstdc++.so.6: version GLIBCXX_3.4.29' not found (required by ./d1x-rebirth)
./d1x-rebirth: /lib/aarch64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6: version GLIBC_2.34' not found (required by ./d1x-rebirth)
./d1x-rebirth: /lib/aarch64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6: version `GLIBC_2.32' not found (required by ./d1x-rebirth) 
```

ArkOS only uses up to GLIBC 2.30 and as ArkOS is no longer maintained, this port is not compatible.

## Installation
Unzip to ports folder e.g. ```/roms/ports/```. Ready to play with shareware and demo files. To upgrade to full game, purchase on Steam/GOG and then add .hog and .pig files to descent/data and descent2/data.

Descent I & II: Definitive Edition came with some extra content not available on GOG or Steam. These include Levels of the World (Descent 1), 29 Bonus Levels by Parallax Software (Descent 1), and the Descent 2: Vertigo expansion pack. This extra content can be placed in the data/missions folder for both Descent and Descent 2. If done correctly you'll see a new submenu when selecting New Game.

## Configuration
Ini files d1x.ini and d2x.ini are configurable. It is recommended to not touch the Controls section of the ini files.

Keyboard and mouse emulation is used via GPtoKeyB. The file descent.gptk can be opened and modified as user sees fit, but the current assigned keys are recommended for level select. Instead, controls should be modified within the games themselves via Options->Configure Keyboard.

You may rename Player.plr and Player.plx in the conf folder for a different multiplayer display name. If you do so, please modify the d1x.ini or d2x.ini file to reflect this change.

Cheats can be found and modified in cheats.txt. To turn a cheat on, change the 0 to 1. To turn it off, change 1 to 0.
