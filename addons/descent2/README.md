# Add-On Files
Add-On files allow you to customize DXX-Rebirth to your liking. You might prefer certain soundcard midi audio, or even the PS1 soundtrack.
To use an add-on, simply drop the `*.dxa` file into the `descent2/data` folder. These dxa files are just .zip files, so you can open them and modify however you like.

Some of these files are large and are therefore split into archive parts. Simply use something like 7zip to unarchive them.

## Missions
Descent Maximum is the PS1 version of Descent 2. Rather than a straight port, it contains 36 new levels. Descent: Vertigo is an extension of the original Descent 2 campaign. Place in `descent2/data/missions`.

## Other
In the `other` folder you'll find the following:

- `d2xr-ws-menus.dxa` which corrects the menu aspect ratios on widescreen devices, so the logos aren't stretched.

## Shareware
In the `shareware` folder you'll find the Descent 2 demo files. These contain the first three levels of the game. Version differences are explained and showcased at [The Cutting Room Floor](https://tcrf.net/Proto:Descent_II_(PC)).

## Additional Add-Ons
Missions can be found and downloaded from [Descent Mission Archive](https://sectorgame.com/dxma/)
