# Add-On Files
Add-On files allow you to customize DXX-Rebirth to your liking. You might prefer certain soundcard midi audio, or even the PS1 soundtrack.
To use an add-on, simply drop the .dxa file into the `descent/data` folder. These dxa files are just .zip files, so you can open them and modify however you like.

Some of these files are large and are therefore split into archive parts. Use something like 7zip to unarchive them.

Usage: .dxa files go in the `descent/data` folder. Levels of the World's entire directory can be placed in `descent/data/missions` or you can cherry pick your favorites.
