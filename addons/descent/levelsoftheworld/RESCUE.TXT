Name of Mission:  Diplomatic Rescue

Preface: Attention Material Defender!

The praseodymium and neodymium mining
outpost on Jupiter moon Ganymede has just
been invaded by the Boss Robot's minions.
Praseodymium and neodymium are rare-earth
twins that form a green salt ore.  Both are
known to give glass unique refractive
properties.

The mine was thought to be secure!  At the
time of the invasion, high ranking officials
were reviewing research to preclude such
a take-over.  We cannot say who is involved,
but only that all the hostages must be
returned alive!

A Top-Gun security team was dispatched
along with the bureaucrats, so weapons
should be plentiful.  The scientist were
researching personal cloaking and light
refractive hall-of-mirror (HOM) devices.
Some of the hostages (and robots) may
be cloaked; trust only your instrumentation
and not your eyes Material Defender.

Maintain radio silence after descent or the
hostages may be killed.  Proceed quickly;
the element of surprise is your only hope.

Good luck, Material Defender!

Authors note:

I designed this level with playability in
mind considering the twenty minute rule
hile still trying to make it challenging.
It is hard to define the "average person"
and what skill level the game will be played
at and how much the map function will be
used.  Most of the level flows well such that
the map function should not be required
that often.  Since I was unclear, I used my
6 & 8 year old boys to be the judges.
In the trainer mode they both could get
through the level under 25 minutes.  I can
get through it in less than 15 minutes and
still use the map to simulate not knowing.
