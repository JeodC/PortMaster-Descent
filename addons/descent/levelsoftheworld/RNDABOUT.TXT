Description of Mission:
The Roundabout is my first level.  It's
intended for Anarchy play (There are
no robots), and is large enough for
eight players.

The level is almost all tunnels, with
very few rooms, and no large rooms.
It's also very dark inside.  The door to
the reactor room takes a while to shoot
open, just keep trying.
