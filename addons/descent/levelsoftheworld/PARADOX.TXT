Name of Mission: Paradox

Description Of Mission:
This is meant to be a multiplayer mission
(The more people the better). Because of
this, there are no keycards, keydoors, or
hostages, and the level is fairly symmetrical.

The name comes from the fact that you can
fly through a corridor into a big room, but when
you look at where the corridor should be, there
is nothing there! (If you don't understand what
I mean, play the level and you will see.) There
are 2 of all the major weapon types, some
cloaking devices, a energy recharge area, and
lots of clever traps (if I do say so myself).

There is one secret area with 4 smart missiles
and 2 mega missiles. It is hard to get into, but
don't stop stop playing until you find it. I put
in some pretty nasty robots for "practice"
one-player games. With all the cool weapons,
you should be able to beat it without dying,
after a little practice. Once you find the traps,
they are great for laying in wait for another
player.
