Alpha Centuri Mining Consortium
Author: Nigel Keogh

This is my first go at a Descent level mission.  It
should play as normal, anarchy or multi-player/coop. 
I've included lots of tricks and traps for those who
like that sort of thing and have been told by a friend
who test-played it for me that it's a tough level
(When designing a level it's so hard to tell, since you
know all the secrets.).

On all the planets of the Alpha Centuri system that have
been designated as mining planets, the valuable minerals
are buried deep, hence the deep shafts.

If you have trouble finding keys and passageways, bear
in mind that I favor trap doors in floors.  Also, the exit on
this one is a bit tricky, but I'll let you figure that out for 
yourself. Enjoy.
