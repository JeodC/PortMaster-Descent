Name of Mission: Ice's Sewers

Description of Mission: Ice's Sewers contains water,
which really adds a "new" perspective to the game.
The whole concept is a sewage system; from the main
sewer tunnels to the drained, algae filled pools (the
algae pools were added because I reached the maximun
number of walls Descent would handle).

And to top it off, it's DARK! It's really nasty when you
crank up the difficulty level.  There are several hidden
door and triggers that should test the players ability to
solve riddles. Remember to wear your waders!
