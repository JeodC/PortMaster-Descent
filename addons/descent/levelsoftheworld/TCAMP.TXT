Mission: Training Camp

Hello, fellow Descenters.  This is
Spydir(irc nick). My real name is
Arlo James Aude.  The level, Training Camp, is
intended to be an anarchy level.  I've tried
to the best of my ability to make it nice
and clean.  The textures are all aligned and
besides the doors and some of the steel
support looking textures, I have tried to
make it look as if all the walls have
thickness.  I've also strayed away from
the 4D effects.  The chinese box level was
enough for me.

Training Camp is large enough so that 8 people
could play comfortably in it.  Some of my previous
levels were regarded as cramped, so I strived to
think large with this one.

If you have any questions, problems, or suggestions,
please e-mail me at gt9605a@prism.gatech.edu.

Later, Spydir...

PS: For anyone who has an earlier version, you will
find this one much more manageable.  I reduced the
number of cubes in the starting rooms from around
75 to around 40.  That's about a 2x speed gain.  I
hope it helps. Besides the speed, I really like the
newer look of the room.
