Mission: Gehenna

Desc.:  First of all, let me say this is an
upgrade from TARTARUS. I fixed the exit
door, so you can't exit until you blow up the
mine. I also re-did this file because my dumb
butt erased the old one before I figured out I
had a bug :( :| :)

It's your worst nightmare, only you don't get to
hide under the covers.

CAUTION: HIGHLY ADDICTIVE! This level is unique
to any other. YOU CHOOSE THE NUMBER OF
ROBOTS YOU FACE! (Cool) Filled with puzzles and
traps; nothing is as it seems. Go down every corridor,
kill every robot, find every secret! Be paranoid!
If something looks like nothing, there is a sure
bet it does something! If you find yourself unable
to open a door, i.e. red key, there is NO bug! I know
I have done the key entrances correct, I've been
through all of them myself many times. Be
prepared to face the ultimate
brainteaser/shoot 'em up! Macros to DIE for!
