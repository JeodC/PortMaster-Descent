Name of Mission: Nailed! version 3.0

Description of Mission:
A new mission that contains 7 new levels
for your enjoyment.  It is composed of a
unique blend of rooms, tunnels, and as the
name implies - situations that really "nail"
you.

I think that you will find these levels
increase in difficulty (as they should and at
the rate that they should) and in complexity
(check out the maps during the game!). It is
ready for deathmatch and cooperative play,
so this mission should be suitable for just
about everyone.
