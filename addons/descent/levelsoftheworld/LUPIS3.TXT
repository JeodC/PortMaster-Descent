Name of Mission: Lupis Three

Description of Mission:
Lupis Three takes you into the somewhat newly
infested Lupis system. It is important to
remember three things when playing this level:

1. Don't blow the reactor until you have seen the
exit.

2. Flares can disclose even the most transparent
of enemies.

3. Baby spiders only take one single hit from a
plasma gun to destroy.

This level is excellent for individual or
deathmatch play. Large design and fully
multiplayer supported.
