Agitation - How to have a headache

This level is designed to trick even
the most wily of people.  If you think
your eyes can handle anything, you are wrong.
This level irritates everyone, yet it is still
enjoyable.  Its many well placed enemies challenge
the most hardened Descent junkies.  Yet, you don't
just have to use your cheesy level 1 laser. You are
given many strong weapons to use in your fight.
Conservation of energy is imperative. To preserve
the sacred mood of destruction, music has intentionally
been omitted. This level is best played in complete dark
with no distracting noise.
