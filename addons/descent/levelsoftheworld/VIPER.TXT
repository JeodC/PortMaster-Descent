Name of Mission:
Viper's Playground

Decription of Mission: Designed with the
DEVIL editing tool, the level in its present
state uses some of my favorite "tricks" to
fool, confuse, and destroy the player. The
level can be played solo or cooperatively.
The level starts with a sort of maze to hunt
for the blue key.

Next you're asked to find the hidden doors
to the next part of the level where the
yellow key is hidden. The search for the
red key begins next, and then on to the
final confrontation with the reactor and
its protectors. Sounds easy huh?:-).

The level asks you to use all of your flying,
thinking, and running skills. Some areas of
the level are best left alone unless you know
the secrets of how to conquer that particular
part of the level. The level is designed with
some Doom-like textures on the opening
level, but this is not to suggest that I was
trying to make it another Doom level replica.
I simply made what I liked regardless of how
it would look, and some of it turned looking
like Doom; cool huh?

The best thing I can say for the level is
its fun! Good luck, you'll need it!!
