Mission Name: CICERO OUTPOST

Mission Description: Cicero Outpost is a large
level that can be played solo, co-operatively
or in anarchy mode. Starts of all types have been
included. It adheres to normal physical rules and
feels really 'solid' and 'heavy' in places.

It has been rigorously tested as a solo player level.
It includes a huge central chamber where dogfights
with other players or robots are really challenging.
Keys and power-ups are sometimes in the open,
sometimes heavily protected and often deviously
hidden! Different areas are often connected by more
than one route giving a choice of approaches to
important locations. The exit is a very long run
although there is time to just make it if playing on
INSANE. There is a secret shortcut though which
should save enough time to allow the collection of
all final run bonuses.
