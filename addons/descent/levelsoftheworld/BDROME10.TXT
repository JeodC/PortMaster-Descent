Mission Name:  BattleDrome 1.0

This is my first attempt at a level.  It began
as a multiplayer anarchy-only level, but grew
robots a while later.

The main purpose of this level is to slaughter
other players. That's it.  It may, however, be
played and enjoyed as a single-player or robo-
anarchy level as well.  Enjoy, and drop me a line
with comments or suggestions:

I'm sure there will be other levels that follow, and
hopefully, they'll get progressively better.

Many thanks to Achim Stremplat for his awesome
work on DEVIL.  I can't wait for the Windows version!

Also, many thanks to the people at Parallax, and
Interplay, for without them, my lunch time at work
would be awfully boring.
