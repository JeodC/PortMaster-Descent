Greetings, fellow Pilots. 

And Greetings to Interplay and the DESCENT Team
for putting together the best damn game of
the decade!

*********************************************
This is one of my first levels released using the
Devil Editor 1.01. The name of the Level is call
Advanced Anarchy.  Of course, the name says it all. 

The biggest problem with Chaos Level 2 is that when
you enter one part of the level, you are a sitting
duck, and no way to get out!! Not anymore!

This is level 2 from the original TOTAL CHAOS Pack,
but with alot of changes:

Tons of hiding places and lots of doors to retreat to.

No more can you wait and know no one is behind you >:)

Also the Exit has been hidden (HINT: Think Yellow)

See if you can find it WIThout cheating and loading
the level up into DEVIL.

Enjoy and WATCH YOUR BACK IN THIS ONE :)
