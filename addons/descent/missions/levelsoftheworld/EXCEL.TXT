Description: Covert Mining Operations have been
discovered in the Alpha Centuri Star Cluster,
specifically on the Century Post Excelsior Base,
located on a moon orbiting Gamma Huirami 2.

Our readings from Long Range Probes in that
sector indicate that there is a central intelligence
controlling the mining and defense craft which are
controlling the base.

Destruction of this central unit, which we believe
to be an alien vessel, should cause a cascade of
explosions within the base power system, which
would destroy the base itself. Good Luck!
