Description of Mission: The five floors of
The Corkscrew provide a unique challenge.
Finding the way to the Blue and Red keys will
take a bit of looking -- keep trying. Also,
look for the way into the center of the
corkscrew ramps, finding it may prove
invaluable. 

The Corkscrew is also an excellent level
for multi-player games, but you will probably
find it too large for Anarchy play with less than
four players.
