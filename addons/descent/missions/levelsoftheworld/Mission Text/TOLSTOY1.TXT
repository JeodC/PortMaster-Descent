Title: Tolstoy Mine #1

Mission Briefing

Officials at the Tolstoy Mineral Complex
(Mine #1) have informed you that the
mine has been compromised.  Several
hostages remain at the site.  You should
prepare for swift and aggressive
resistance from the 'bots controlling
the site.
  
Intelligence indicates access to the
hostage location is likely  hidden.
The last known communication from
the mine indicated the staff was
unable to destroy all of the holographic
image projection systems in use at the
facility...

[ Authors Note:  This level can be tough at
higher skill settings! Careful use of the
existing 'powerups' in the facility is
required for success.  Level is designed for
single or multi-player, or anarchy.]
