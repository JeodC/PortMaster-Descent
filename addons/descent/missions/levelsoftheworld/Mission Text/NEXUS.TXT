Going on the whole, everything is
possible in the Descent environment.
I've created a level with a little more
solidity in it's objects.  Most of the
levels out there use the 3D effects of
the Descent engine to create corridors
that move in all 3 directions.

The difference which sets this level apart
from those is that the corridors have a nice
walkway going through them.  There are
some secret hiding places inside this
walkway as well which contain objects,
such as a mega missile, smart, etc.  This
sort of technique usually requires a lot of
cubes to accomplish, but I tried my best
to reduce that number to a minimum,
though the level may still be slow on some
machines.  There are only three 4D corridors
in this level. I'm sorry about this, but I
needed them to tie the whole thing together.
I'll try my hardest to avoid using any 4D effect
in future levels.  I did obtain the lower room
from the chaos2 level, but I believe that I
made significant changes to the area to
warrant calling it original.
