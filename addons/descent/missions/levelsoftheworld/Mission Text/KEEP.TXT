Name of Mission: The Keep

Multiplayer level: An interconnected series of
rooms designed for modem play. There are robots
included for single play, but there are no keys, just
blow the reactor when you get bored. Don’t use the
bots in 2 player, but the extra powerup’s from the
bots are good for network play.  A good variation of play
is guns only in the brown room. Drop the window size
in the brown room for good frame rate if you need to.

I could have reduced structure to speed it up, but it's just
wouldn't be the same. Yes, there are a few stash spots.
If you really, really need a fusion cannon, there is
one in here.
