Name of Mission: Lupis Outposts

Description of Mission: The Lupis system used to
be a very productive system, being rich in resources.
Unfortunately, the Lupis system has not only been
infested by the "intelligent drillers", but it has
been affected by a series of radiation showers
that have mutated some of the infestation that
has taken over this system.

Your mission is to drive the infestation
out of Lupis 1 - 6; only to find that all that are
left in this system are trying to reproduce their
own "homes" at Lupis Outpost Seven (Dejavu design,
but not game play). This level is excellent for
individual, Anarchy, or co-op play. Large design
and fully multiplayer supported.
