SS Alexander: A Descent Mission
Author: Nigel Keogh 

So here's the deal:  The space station Alexander
(the first though certainly not the last of the
superstations--there are others in lesser degrees
of completion dotted about the solar system) has
been overrun by aggressive bots from the mining
planet about which it orbits. Alexander's main
purpose is to supply food to the miners by growing
and processing a form of lichen--it's the stuff on
the bed forms.  The station was intended to be almost
totally automated and manned by drone robots.
Unfortunately, these same drones were easily enlisted
by the planetary forces.

Good luck.  Hate to lose the station, but what can you
do?  By the way, your exit route is slightly circuitous
(necessary on a space station of this design) so plan
it out carefully in advance of blowing the reactor.

Additional note: The concept of designing a space
station-based mission was one that I had wholly
independently. It wasn't until after I'd had the
idea and begun work on the level that I ran across
alpha4.zip, which is of course four levels that take
place on a space station. It happens.
