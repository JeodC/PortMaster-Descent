Mission Name:  Caverns of Croix 1.1

This level will take you deep into the caverns
of the distant asteroid of Croix.  Very few have
ever escaped with their lives! Your mission is to
take out the main reactor, which is inside a
plasma core.  Once the reactor has been destroyed,
you must waste no time in escaping (unless you
find the secret passage to the exit).

Keep an eye out for hidden areas - use the map to
spot areas that may be hidden by textures or false
walls!

You will enjoy this level the most using a Pentium,
but it can  still be played on lesser machines.  The
humungous caverns may cause some slide-show
action on slow machines.

Try this level in single-player, or go head-to-head
with others. You can also play cooperatively with
others, if you can avoid the urge to fire on others.
