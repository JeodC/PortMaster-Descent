This level is the second level we have created,
and the first we build together. Originally, we
wanted a level without a reactor, because the idea
was that, in this mine, the energy is produced by
thermal powerstations. You can see them in some of
the rooms. They are the ventilators at the floors, over
these the flicker isn't the sign of a fuel center, it
simulates the hot gases of the lava.

At testing in a netgame we found out that the level is
a little hard with a Big Boss 2 ,so we changed the Boss
to a reactor. This level was designed for a multiplayer
game with up to 8 player in robot-anarchy mode, but
you can play it alone if you want to die, or in
cooperative mode with up to 4 players.

Good luck and watch your six.  -Kai

So - you dare to try out our little level ? Well, Psycho
didn't manage to solve it in anything above ROOKIE yet
- let alone to me - so good luck.

If You find it too easy (i.e. You are nuts !), feel free
to change the reactor back to Big Boss 2 (THEN we
DIDN'T manage to solve this level in single player
mode at all).

By the way, in case your computer is a bit to slow
for this level, blame it on me (I found out, that my
486-50 is out of date for that level), and send me a
mail, or better, don't.

OK, have fun and prepare to die ...
hahahahahahahhaha...aaarghhhh... !!
