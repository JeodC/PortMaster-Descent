This is my attempt to create a level which
utilizes 4D effectively. I have seen other 4D
levels which attempt to promote this effect,
but the novelty is all that is conferred.

Barium originally started out as a total remake
of Cobalt, but soon took on a life of it's own, which
is why the name changed to Barium.  Some people
may notice the name Cobbler on the automap.  I used
"Cobbler" because my girl friend and I were fighting
one night while I was working on the level, over the
proper way to prepare such a delightful treat.  Unlike
Training Camp, this level has many robots, two keyed
doors, and 4 hostages.  You may have trouble getting to
the 3 hostages on the bottom floor, but don't fret; the
blue keyed door is a hidden one which is easily found. 

The reactor may also be an enigma for some.  You have
to go into 4D space to get to it.  Just keep looking
around and don't trust your real world, real space, mass
or volume-centered paradigms.  In virtual space, any
dream can be digitized.
