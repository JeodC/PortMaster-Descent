Name of Mission:
In Square Out

Description of Mission:
"Pyramid" is my fourth attempt at
building levels. The name is derived
from the cubes (pyramids) in the
two large rooms. The level is not
all that big but it does require a
bit of puzzle solving. The level
does not contain near as many
robots as "In Square Out" but
because of the added puzzles it
is just as much fun.

Have Fun!
