Name of Mission: Lupis Six

Description of Mission:
Lupis Six has just been infected by the
mutated kin of Lupis Five. Fortunately,
the infection is limited -- for now. Be
amazed at the new tunneling skill of the
heavy drillers! Watch out for those invisible
baddies; you just never know where they
might show up next. This level is excellent for
individual or deathmatch play. Large design
and fully multiplayer supported.
