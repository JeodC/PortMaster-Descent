Name of Mission: Lupis Seven

Description of Mission:
Lupis Seven was originally designed to be the
seventh level in a series (that is why there is
a big boss at the end). The level has been made
to be played as either an individual level or
as the ending to a series of levels (there are
enough weapons to be fair). The Lupis system
has been affected by a series of radiation showers
that have mutated some of the infestation that has
taken over this system. After driving the infestation
out of Lupis 1 - 6, all that are left in this system
are trying to reproduce their own "homes" on this
level (Dejavu design, but not game play).

This level is excellent for individual, Anarchy,
or co-op play. Large design and fully multiplayer
supported.
