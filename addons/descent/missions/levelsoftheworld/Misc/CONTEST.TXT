                                       ABOUT THE CONTEST

     When we announced the Descent: Levels Of The World Contest in August
of 1995, we certainly expected some response.  At most, we thought we'd
get 50 submissions, some of them would be really cool, we'd give away the
prizes and have a great time.

     Imagine our surprise, then, when received over three times that many
submissions, and that over 120 of them would be of a high enough quality
to be included on the disk. The task of simply playing each level for 15
or 20 minutes was incredibly daunting.  Judging them was even harder; some
of you guys are INCREDIBLE designers.  Some of you are also incredibly
twisted; I admire that trait in a designer, <grin>.  My hat is off to each
and every one of you.

     That's not to say some of the levels don't have some problems; there
were around 15 we considered not putting on this disk.  But, darn it, so much
work had been put into the levels, we felt the designers at least had the
right to let the public judge the results.  We've included the EMail
addresses for the designer of each level; please drop them a line and let
them know that their hard work and creativity are appreciated.

     So, we didn't try to fix any of the obvious faux pas.  We'll let the
work of the designers stand on their own merits.  If you have problems
with a level on this disk, drop the designer an EMail; they know their
design far better than we ever could.
