Type: single or multiplayer (anarchy or cooperative)

Cubik is a level designed mainly for anarchy play,
but will also work as a single player level.  It's
features are a single, central large room ideal for
deathmatch fests, surrounded by a tunneling system
that redirects players back to the center room.  All
three keys are included, as well as hostages.  Cubik
is so named because virtually all the building
polygons consist of squared off cubes.  Enjoy.
