Description of Mission:

One of our outposts on Mars has been
infected by a computer virus. Scientists
there were in the process of examining the
core memory of one of the captured bots,
when they triggered a security program
that inserted this virus into all of the
vital outpost systems. This virus seems
to be the cause of all our recent problems.
The group of scientists on the martian
colony have sent a distress call requesting
rescue procedures be initiated. The group
is quite small, and Professor Kulas has told
us that half of their group hasn't made it to
the emergency bunker.  He believes that the
robots most likely captured them and are
holding them somewhere within the complex.

Your mission is to rescue the hostages,
cleanse the outpost of any infected bots,
then blow the reactor, and make it out
alive.

This is probably going to be one of the hardest
missions we've sent you on, PTMC Defender, so
watch your back. We are inserting you only about
8 hours after the infection, so traps will
probably be at a minimum, but they have had
plenty of time to deploy their numbers in a
defensive posture. Opposition will be heavy.

Good Luck, PTMC Defender.
