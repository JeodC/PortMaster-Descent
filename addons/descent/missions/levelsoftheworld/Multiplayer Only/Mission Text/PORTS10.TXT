Mission: Ports O' Kill 1.0

This level contains a few very large
rooms, and makes for good practice
trying to dodge megamissiles and
other weaponry.  It provides the wide
open expanses that some enjoy, as well
as some hidden areas that provide smaller
arenas for battle and strategy.

Any comments or suggestions?
