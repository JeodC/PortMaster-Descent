Name of Mission:  Cubic Chaos
     
Description of Mission: This Anarchy-only
level is a huge cube that contains many access
tunnels that run in and out of it.  Many of these
tunnels lead to the same places, so you never know
when you're gonna bump into someone as you fly
through them.  This level is truly insane with eight
players going at it, with fighting always going on in
the central cube.  Have fun with this one!
