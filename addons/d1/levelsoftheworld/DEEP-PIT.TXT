Description of Mission: Delve deep into the
iron-rich asteroid to flush out the mining
robots gone amok.  The reactor room is hidden
behind a secret panel, so look well.

Deep Pit Mine was designed with single-person
play in mind, although multi-player games work
well because, of the many large rooms.
