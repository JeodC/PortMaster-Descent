Name of Mission:
Venus Waste Processing Plant

Modes of Play: Single-Co-op-Death

Description: This mine is a very small
and simple one, with a couple of
puzzles, some nice scenery and few
robots.  The robots I picked, however,
are tough and intentionally placed to
make life miserable. The only problem
I have experienced with this mine is
that it will not play in robo-anarchy,
but it plays fine in all other modes.

Hope you like it!!!!
