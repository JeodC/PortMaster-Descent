Name of Mission:
Venus Production Plant

Description: This is a large mine in
which i was shooting for a balance
of robots and puzzles to make it not
only exciting, but mentally challenging
as well.  You can play it in any mode,
but I feel it's best in single play.
While playing, you will notice that the
exit door is activated by the red key
rather than blowing the reactor.  I don't
know what the deal is but for some
reason the door (after repeated attempts
at fixing it) just won't react to the blown
reactor, so i did it this way.  So don't go
out until you blow it, 'cause it will let
you out.
