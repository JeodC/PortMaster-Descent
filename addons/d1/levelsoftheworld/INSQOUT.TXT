Name of Mission:  In Square Out

Description of Mission:  

"In square out" is my second attempt at a descent level.
In square out uses the 4D effect but not to confuse.
The main room is very large but I found it most enjoyable
to battle several robots in this room. It challenges your
maneuvering skills to evade all the fire. The rest of the
level is simple enough as far as solving the puzzle.
However, once the big boss is destroyed, do not dilly-dally.

Have fun!
