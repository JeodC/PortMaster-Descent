Name of Mission: Operation ResQ

Description of mission:
Four days ago, we lost contact with
the Starship Kaliber, a scientific
vessel collecting geological data on
a planet that was thought to be
uninhabited.  Twenty four hours ago
we sent a probe to scan the area for
life forms.  The information from
the probe showed the planet to be
infested with 'bots' and the four
scientists are nowhere to be found.

Thats where you come in.

Your mission is to rescue the hostages,
terminate all 'bots' and destroy
the planet.

Good luck. We're all counting on you.
