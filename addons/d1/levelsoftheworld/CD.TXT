Name of Mission:  Creeping Death

Description of Mission:  While you were out
on your 'First Strike', a large asteroid infested
with robots had drifted deep into space without
anyone knowing about it.

After completing your mission for the
organization, it was time to get that paycheck. 
After all, you earned every penny of it, and you
wanted it NOW!  So, as the slick pilot that you
are, you decided to take a shortcut through the
Bermuda Nebula (similar to the Bermuda
Triangle on earth), saving 30 hours and getting
home that much sooner.

Because your instruments are not that accurate
in the Nebula, you didn't see that asteroid until
it was almost too late.  Quickly, you started an
emergency landing procedure and brought the
ship down safely.

After the dust clears, you take a look out the
window, and you see a Supervisor Droid pulling
a man into a cave and realize that your mission
has just begun.
