Name of Mission: Death Star

What have the 'bots been doing with all
the metal from our mines?

Description: After you cleaned out all the mines,
Material Defender, the corporation sent out
construction crews to rebuild them and resume
mining operations. But all the minerals are
gone! There's nothing left to mine! We followed
a few stragglers out into deep space and found a
large object. We believe the last of the 'bots
(and our material resources) are there.

Your mission: Wipe out the last of the 'bots
and find out what they've been doing with the
metals they took from our mines.

Additional Credits to:

Without Ken Washburn's playtesting and
Kerrie Washburn's styling suggestions
this level wouldn't have been anywhere
near as good as it is!
