Level Name: Illusions

Characteristics: A level for multiplayer mode only.

Notes: My newest level and, I might say, it isn't
that bad! Illusions is a level that I made using
Devil1.2.  It is composed of 4 big domes with balls
in the middle. Each ball has three different tunnels
going into it.  This level is quite large and may run
a little slow on some computers, sorry! :)
