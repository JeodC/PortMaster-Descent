Name of Mission: Technic Cleansing

Description of mission:
Designed for SOLO-PLAY
8 Deathmatch starts, 4 Co-op starts
Yellow, Blue, and Red key
4 hostages, 1 reactor
Unlimited mayhem!

Descent's most unruly robots have
been impounded at a prison asteroid.
A fleet of blue Guardian-bots were
assigned to watch over this hi-tech
prison, but something went wrong.
They have rebelled and captured 4
hostages.  It's up to you to bail the
hostages from this jailhouse rock...
and to make things worse, the robot
inmates remember who imprisoned
them in the first place!

"A little rebellion now and then is
a good thing."
-Thomas Jefferson, 1787
