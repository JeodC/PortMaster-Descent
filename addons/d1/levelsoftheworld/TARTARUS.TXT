Mission: Tartarus

Desc:  There is no escape! Virtually no robots
in the mine's key levels at first, but as you
progress you will decide how many monsters
you face later in the mission!

Outstanding macros you will be desperate to
have!

WARNING!!!!!!!!!:IF YOU HAVE I-CAN'T-STOP-
TILL-I-BEAT-IT syndrome, DON'T PLAY THIS
LEVEL! Nothing is as it seems. If you want an
item, be prepared to pay for it!

Just remember this:

ANYTHING that looks like it is nothing, is
important! Many doors are triggered by
switches. Have fun and rest in peace! The
answer on how to access the red key and other
secrets are listed below for those who can't
figure it out by themselves! Please read
it when you are done though.
