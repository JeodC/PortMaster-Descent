The Arena of Death

Welcome the arena of Descent, gladiators!

This level was made with the warrior in mind. 
It is not too big, so won't spend all your time
jumping around corners looking for the oppenent.
By the same token, it is not too small where you
find the oppenent around every turn.  It is made
with fairness toward the warriors in mind.  There
are no programmed mega or smart missles but there
will be some generated at random by the computer.
You have to work for those kills here with good shooting
and stratagy, not just shooting a mega or smart
missile into a room and let it do the work for you...
unless, of course, that's what you enjoy.

There are cloaking devices but no "programmed"
invulnerability but, again, some will be generated
at random by the game.

The weapons you will find are spread- and vulcan
cannons, quad lasers, laser level upgrades, concussion
and homing missles.

As I said, this is geared toward everyone coming into
a fair fight knowing the arena and all of its tricks. 
There are 7 death-match starting places and one
single-player starting place for the purpose of running
through it and familarizing yourself with it.

Anyway, thats the story behind the arena.  Have fun and
hope you enjoy it.
