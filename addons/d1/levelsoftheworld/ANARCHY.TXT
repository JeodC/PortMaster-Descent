* ANARCHY *

I built this level strictly for multiplayer games. 
I tried to make it pretty interesting.  I usually
play 4 player network with some friends, so I put
together my own level for head to head combat. 
I called it 'Anarchy.' 

If you like the level... please let me know. 
I am a musician and I have alot of time on my
hands sometimes, so I spent alot of time on it. 
It is the first level I have ever built with DEVIL. 
It's a great program, and I had alot of fun.  

Email me with some feedback if you liked the level.
