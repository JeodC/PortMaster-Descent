Name of Mission:
Captain Rye's Rescue

Description of mission: Designed for a
solo one-player game. Supports 6
Deathmatch starts, 4 Co-op starts, Yellow,
Blue, and Red keys, 6 hostages, 1 reactor.

Captain Rye, who has a great deal of hostile-
mech knowledge, must be rescued.  Escaping
the cell that still holds the other hostages,
Captain Rye has managed to communicate that
he has disabled a hostile robot and used it's
equipment to bore out a cave for himself. He
has used scraps and equipment to set up a
series of door-opening motion triggers. He is
counting on only the best of our human pilots
to be able to trigger them and make their way
into his hide-out.

And pilot... don't laugh when you see him. His looks
betray the fact that he's one of our toughest little
buggers. The mission can only be considered a true
success if Captain Rye is rescued.

(Here's a hint if you'd like one; page down to it. If not,
then stop reading)












Hint: You'll have to make use of more than one directional thruster.
