Abyss 1.0

You are plunged into inner space in
this Descent adventure beneath the sea!
Your mission is to rescue a team of undersea
miners from the clutches of a race of alien
robotic guardians.  The drillers, unaware of
their intrusion, opened up a fissure in the
floor of the abyss, releasing a wave of these
aliens into the watery depths of our world.
If you can blow the main reactor, the explosion
should be large enough to destroy the alien
trespassors, and seal the fissure for good.

Note that sometimes your perception under water
may be skewed and, certain times, walls may
appear to move with distortion as you move by them.

You will enjoy this level the most using a Pentium,
but it can  still be played on lesser machines.

Try this level in single-player, or go head-to-head
with others. You can also play cooperatively with
others, if you can avoid the urge to fire on them.
