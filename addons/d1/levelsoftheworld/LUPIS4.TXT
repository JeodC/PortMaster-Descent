Name of Mission: Lupis Four

Description of Mission:
Lupis Four takes you into the totally
infested Lupis system. At Lupis Outpost Three
there was a secret escape route due to the
possibilty of termination -- so the robots took it.
Now, these same mining robots have taken
Lupis Outpost Four; don't think that they have
forgotten you! This time, it's personal.
This level is excellent for individual or
deathmatch play. Large design and fully
multiplayer supported.
