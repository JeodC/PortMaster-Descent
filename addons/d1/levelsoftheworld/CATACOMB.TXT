Name of Mission: The Catacombs           
      
Description of Mission: This mission began with
several simple rooms I created and was quite happy
with.  These are the 3D ball-shaped intersection at
the bottom of the blue tunnel, the 2 rooms that are
wide enough to see through but not wide enough to
fly through (the caged Vulcans were a cool idea I
added later), the two "Arenas" with the floating boxes
in the middle, and the large series of identical rooms I 
call "The Catacombs".  Hope you enjoy.
