Name of Mission: Tribyss Omega

Description of Mission: Tribyss Omegas
use to be an orbiting space
station whose orbit disintegrated
and crashed on a moon's surface. Still
operational, but not fully intact, a
salvage operation commenced to make
it into a mining facility. During the
conversion, needless to say, the
robots took over.
