Abandoned Base 1.0 

The distress call has long since
dissipated in space.  All that
remains is an empty shell of a base.
There are no apparent signs of trouble
-- the occupants seem to have vanished.

Rumors have long since spread through-
out the sector that this base held some
secret that, in the right hands, could
result in riches beyond belief.  Others,
like you, are already enroute to this base.
You may, in your scavenging, run into
others attempting to benefit from the bounty
of this abandoned base.  You may need to
apply deadly force to expel the other
fortune seekers, for you know that you
are entitled to the wealth of the base, and
all of the others are obviously trespassing.
