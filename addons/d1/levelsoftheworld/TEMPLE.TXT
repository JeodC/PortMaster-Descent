Description: Deathmatch Level
My friend Tim told me about this
building in the city that looked
like a Descent temple, which gave
me the idea for this level.
                
Thanks to Achim Stremplat for DEVIL
and thanks to Chris Lautenbach
for HOGUtil.

Additional thanks to my friends who I
play Deathmatch with. Thanks for helping
me come up with new ideas on how to
kill you. :)
