SLIMOD12:
A SLIGHTLY MODIFIED LEVEL 12

It's basically a variation of the
Level 12 scheme of things (one of
my favorites) but probably has a
little something from just about
all levels.

This level was constructed using the
new and improved MMCP technology
(Mega Macro Cut-and-Paste).  Real
laziness here, folks, and believe me,
I feel as bad about it as you do!

Although representing plagarism at
its finest (or worst), I simply hope
you find it a fun level for either
multi-player games or the solo flights.

Feel free to dissect any part of this
you like for your own: after all...

I did.
