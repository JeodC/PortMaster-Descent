This level is for multiplayer only, unless you
just want some practice flying.

I created this level because a group of us at work
like to play at lunch time, and some of the levels
in the the chaos mission just weren't liked by the
boys in the office.  Hence I created deathmat to
replace level chaos5.rdl. Let me know if you like
my level, or to give me suggestions for new ones.

I think that I'm getting hang of this DEVIL thing.
