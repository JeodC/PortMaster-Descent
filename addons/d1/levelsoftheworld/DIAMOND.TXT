Deep Jovian Diamond Mine

No email address - maybe someday:)

After the outer planets were purged of the alien
menace, officials at PTMC began the arduous task
of cleanup at their critical mining sites. A cleanup
crew working on IO restored  the command center
and re-established sensors and communications.

At first the strange emmisions coming from the
main planet were thought to be natural - electrical
storms and such. But upon careful examination, the
emissions were identified as those of a PTMC reactor
core, badly in need of repair. Computer records were
searched, but none existed for any mines in that sector
of Jupiter, deep within the planet's crust. A repair crew
was dispatched to investigate.  They never returned.

Finally, a senior partner of PTMC came forward,
admitting a private diamond-mining venture using PTMC
equipment had been started just before the alien
infestation. No mining had actually taken place yet and
only the entry dome and power reactor had been installed.
The first material defender to be sent to the mine has not
returned and is presumed dead. Infestation level is expected
to be high. Recommend two material defenders work as a
team to eradicate this final threat to the solar system.

For multiplayer (up to 4), cooperative use; no non-coop
start points in level.  Can be played single-player, but
wasn't designed for it.
