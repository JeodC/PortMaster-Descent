MISSION INSTRUCTIONS

An Advanced Armaments Research
Station has been uncovered on a newly
discovered phantom moon orbiting Pluto.
Research is being conducted into heavy
weapons and, because of the cyclo-G
construct, we suspect anti-gravity
research as well. This station is known
to be heavily guarded.

We've recently had intelligence that
mechs can sometimes be turned to help
with a mission. Keep an eye out for
potential turncoats, but be careful.

If you experience difficulties at the
Station, consult your log to see if you
have received a classified briefing with
further details.
