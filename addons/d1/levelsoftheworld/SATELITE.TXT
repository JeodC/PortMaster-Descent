Name of Mission:  Satellite

Description of Mission:

The name "SATELLITE" is derived from
the map, after most of the level has
been played. The level does require a
bit of puzzle solving and it contains
a large number of cubes.

However, the majority of the cubes are
used in the satellite rings. All robots
can be killed in the level. Some of them
are hard to get at. Don't forget to pick
up the hostages before blowing
the reactor.

Have Fun!
