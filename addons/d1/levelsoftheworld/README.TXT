Make sure the Descent: Levels Of The World CD is in your CD-ROM drive.
From the Windows95 desktop, click on start, then go up to programs and

the first window and find the CD Rom drive. It is usually D or E.  You
will see the files come up on the right hand side. Find the DLOTW folder
and double click on it. Then find the DLOW.EXE file. This will start the

NOTE -- After the Descent game runs, it will leave a DOS box up on your
screen (If you haven't already set the option to close on exit).
You will have to set this (to close) by hand the first time you run!  
You can tell if you need to do this if upon exit from DESCENT, you have a 
box up with "Finished - Descent" as the title.

Click on the upper left (SYSTEM) corner of the DOS Window, select the 
menu item "Properties", and then check the box marked "Close on Exit".
Then, close the box by clicking on the close icon.

TO RUN DESCENT: LEVELS OF THE WORLD FOR DOS:
Make sure the Descent: Levels Of The World CD is in your CD-ROM drive.
If you are running Windows, use ALT+F4 to exit to DOS. From the command
line prompt (usually C: on most PCs), move to your CD-ROM drive main
directory. For example, if your CD-ROM drive is set up as the E: drive,
type:  E: <and press the Enter Key> Type “CD DLOTW” and press the ENTER
key to move into the DLOTW directory. Type DOSLDR to boot the DOS
Browser utility.

TO INSTALL THE LEVELS DIRECTLY INTO DESCENT FROM DOS:
You will need to know the drive designation of your CD-ROM Drive
(usually either D: or E: on most computers) and the directory in which
Descent has been installed (normally C:\\GAMES\\DESCENT). Make sure the
Descent: Levels Of The World CD is in your CD-ROM drive. From the
command line prompt (usually C: on most Pcs), move to your CD-ROM drive
main directory. For example, if your CD-ROM drive is set up as the E:
drive, type: E: <ENTER> Then type CD LEVELS <ENTER>. Then type COPY *.*
C:\\GAMES\\DESCENT. The levels will be copied directly into the Descent
directory. To play one of the new levels, boot Descent. Select NEW GAME,
then select a level to play. NOTE: If your Descent directory is
different than the example used here, type that directory name. For
example, if you have previously installed Descent in a directory named
C:\DESCENT, type: COPY*.*C:\DESCENT

above buttons, a list of the levels will display. To read a description
of the level, simply click once on it.  The description will display in
the box to the right of the list. To launch a level and load Descent,
click once on the level name in the list box on the left of the screen,
then click on the Play Level button at the bottom of the screen.
