Description of Mission:
You are sent to the Gamma quadrant,
where the infestation has been observed
to carve out strange formations in the
rock of alien worlds.  Eradicate the
scourge, save the hostages, blow the
reactor, and emerge savior of
all mankind!

Author's Notes:
This is my first attempt at making
a level for descent.  It was a learning
experience to say the least. I'd suggest
"rookie" or "novice" for the first go
around.  The level is quite tough. 
There are a lot of monsters, but most
of them are of the easy variety--
they just wear you down.

I've never won this level on one guy, but
it's relatively easy to do on two (Hey!
That's why you get more than one--right?)
If you happen to win this level the first
time, drop me a line--I'd like to know
about it.
