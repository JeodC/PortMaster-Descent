Hunting Halls 1.0

Did you ever feel that being cloaked was
not good enough?  Have you ever felt the
need to be virtually invisible to other
players?  This is your chance!

Enter the Hunting Halls!  The dim light is
your friend as you cruise through the hallways
and rooms, hunting other players.

Also, the reactor room is designed so that
anyone attempting to blow up the reactor
before you've had your fill of killing is vulnerable
to attack, so people will learn to leave the reactor
alone, or pay the consequences.
