# Descent 1/2 For PortMaster
The MS-DOS games by Parallax Software ported with DXX-Rebirth v0.61.

## Installation
Unzip to ports folder e.g. ```/roms/ports/```. Ready to play with shareware and demo files. To upgrade to full game, purchase on Steam/GOG and then add .hog and .pig files to descent/data and descent2/data.

Filelist for full versions:  
descent/data  
--descent.hog  
--descent.pig  
--chaos.hog (multiplayer, optional)  
--chaos.msn (multiplayer, optional)  

descent2/data  
--alien1.pig  
--alien2.pig  
--descent2.ham  
--descent2.hog  
--descent2.s11  
--descent2.s22  
--fire.pig  
--groupa.pig  
--ice.pig  
--water.pig  
--intro-h.mvl (optional)  
--other-h.mvl (optional)  
--robots-h.mvl (optional)  


## Configuration
Addon sound files are in the data folders for both games. These files (sc55 and opl3) are both available on the dxx-rebirth website. dxxr-sc55-music.dxa is used by default. To use the opl3 file instead,
add a file extension to the sc55-music file like ```d1xr-sc55-music.dxa.bak```.

A Default pilot profile is preconfigured. For multiplayer, this pilot profile can be renamed or a new one created. If a new pilot is created, you will need to manually assign your joystick controls in the game options. Devices without analog sticks will need to reconfigure controls anyway.

Ini files d1x.ini and d2x.ini are configurable.

## To-Do: QoL Changes
[ ] Default controls (currently manually assigned by user / default pilot)  
[ ] GPToKeyB allow user to scroll through letters to create profile name and enter numbers for level select  
[ ] Hotkeys to skip movies (Descent 2 intro)  
[ ] Cheats...somehow
